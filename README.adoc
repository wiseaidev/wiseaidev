I'm an electrical engineer, graduated 5 years ago. Since then, I've spent over 10k hours working on Open Source projects, but I've always struggled to find a stable, long-term job. Since things didn't work out in that direction, I've decided to go full-time as an Open Source developer and maintainer here on GitHub, pushing the Rust science forward.

'''

== üöß Projects

I'm currently working on Rusty web and AGI development at the following organizations:

- link:https://github.com/opensass[Open SASS]: I'm putting in the effort to make Rust web development extremely accessible for everyone.
- link:https://github.com/kevin-rs[Kevin RS]: I'm researching and building the fastest, most capable agentic framework on the planet.

I'll be releasing a minor update of link:https://github.com/kevin-rs/autogpt[AutoGPT] every Saturday.

== üåê Community

You're welcome to join the Open SASS Discord server for both Rusty Web and AGI development:

|In the beginning, Ferris created Rust and the ownership rules.

|Though I walk through the valley of undefined behavior, I will fear no bugs, for Rust is with me; your compiler and your borrow checker, they comfort me.

|For where two or three are gathered in Rust's name, there Ferris is with them.

|Blessed are the memory safe, for they shall inherit the performance.

|And the compiler said, 'Let there be no nulls,' and there were none.

|Render unto Rust the things that are Rust's, and unto C the things that are C's.

|Rust is my shepherd; I shall not use unsafe.

|Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the compiler will open the gates of concurrency to you.

|He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of the final release.

|For I know the plans I have for you, declares Ferris, plans to prosper you and not to cause data races, plans to give you a future and a hope.
